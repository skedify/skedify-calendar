# Props

Before we start, let's elaborate a few key concepts in the `Calendar` component.

| Key     | Description                                                                                                   |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Event` | When we talk about an `Event` or `Events` we are referring to a calendar event, not a browser event.          |
| `Slot`  | When we talk about `slots` we are referring to a place on the grid. You can think of it as a `cell` in Excel. |

## date

- Type: `Date`
- Default: `new Date()`

The current date used to render the `Calendar`

```js
<Calendar date={new Date(1970, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)} />
```

## events

- Type: `Array`
- Default: `[]`

A list of events to render. Each event should have at least a `start` & `end` prop, e.g.: `{ start: new Date(), end: new Date() }`

```js
<Calendar events={[{ start: new Date(), end: new Date() }]} />
```

## locale

- Type: `string | object`
- Default: `"en"`

For the default renderers (The calendar header and the calender day header), we require some localization.
If you override those headers this value should not be set. We use [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) for this so currently we either expect a string `"en", "nl", "fr" or "de"` or an actual `date-fns` locale.

```js
<Calendar locale="nl" />
```

## weekStartsOn

- Type: `Calendar.MONDAY | Calendar.TUESDAY | Calendar.WEDNESDAY | Calendar.THURSDAY | Calendar.FRIDAY | Calendar.SATURDAY | Calendar.SUNDAY`
- Default: `Calendar.MONDAY`

This determines the beginning of the week.

```js
<Calendar weekStartsOn={Calendar.SUNDAY} />
```

## daysToRender

- Type: `number`
- Default: `7`

How many days should be rendered.

```js
<Calendar daysToRender={5} />
```

## step

- Type: `number`
- Default: `30`

The time in minutes for 1 slot.

```js
<Calendar step={15} />
```

## minTime

- Type: `string`
- Default: `"00:00:00"`

The start time of the Calendar

```js
<Calendar minTime="06:00:00" />
```

## maxTime

- Type: `string`
- Default: `"24:00:00"`

The end time of the Calendar

```js
<Calendar maxTime="17:00:00" />
```

## renderHeader

- Type: `function`
- Default: `Calendar.DEFAULT_RENDER_HEADER`

If you don't want a header you can use this configuration:

```js
<Calendar renderHeader={() => null} />
```

If you do want a header, you get the `start` and the `end` of the current visible range.

```js
<Calendar
  renderHeader={({ start, end }) => (
    <div>
      {start.toLocaleDateString()} - {end.toLocaleDateString()}
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

## renderDayHeader

- Type: `function`
- Default: `Calendar.DEFAULT_RENDER_DAY_HEADER`

If you don't want day headers you can use this configuration:

```js
<Calendar renderDayHeader={() => null} />
```

If you do want a day header, you get the `date` of the current rendered day.

```js
<Calendar renderDayHeader={date => <div>{start.toLocaleDateString()}</div>} />
```

## renderGutterItem

- Type: `function`
- Default: `Calendar.DEFAULT_RENDER_GUTTER_ITEM`

If you don't want a gutter then you can use this configuration:

```js
<Calendar renderGutterItem={() => null} />
```

If you do want a gutter, you get the `time` object of the current slot, the `sizeOfOneSlot` which is the height of 1 slot and the `slotIndex`.

```js
<Calendar
  renderGutterItem={({ time, sizeOfOneSlot, slotIndex }) => (
    <div>{time.toLocaleTimeString()}</div>
  )}
/>
```

## onEventCreate

- Type: `function`
- Default: `undefined`

If this function is not implemented, creatign new events is not possible.
If you do want to make it possible to create new events, you must implement this method.

This method will be called with the following properties:

```js
<Calendar
  onEventCreate={({ start, end }) => {
    // `start` is a date object with the start date/time
    // `end` is a date object with the end date/time
    // Update the state here
    // Maybe call a function that posts this to your API
  }}
/>
```

## onEventUpdate

- Type: `function`
- Default: `undefined`

If this function is not implemented, then **resizing** or **moving** an event is not possible.
If you do want to make it possible to update events, you must implement this method.

This method will be called with the following properties:

```js
<Calendar
  onEventCreate={({ event, start, end }) => {
    // `event` The event that we are going to update
    // `start` is a date object with the new start date/time
    // `end` is a date object with the new end date/time
    // Update the state here
    // Maybe call a function that calls your API to update this
  }}
/>
```

## onEventClick

- Type: `function`
- Default: `undefined`

When this function is implemented, than this function will be called when you click on an event.

```js
<Calendar
  onEventClick={event => {
    // Do things with the event
  }}
/>
```

## canUpdateEvent

- Type: `function`
- Default: `({ event, start, end }) => true`

While we are rendering events we will call this method to determine if we can update this event or not.
For example, if you don't want to overlap events, you can return `true | false` based on this `event` and the new `start` & `end`.

This information will also be available inside the [renderEvent](#renderevent) function.

> **IMPORTANT:** This function will be called a lot of times. This means that this function should be as fast as possible. Don't make API requests in here to determine if we can update this event.

```js
<Calendar
  canUpdateEvent={({ event, start, end }) => {
    return Math.random() > 0.5; // Russian roulette style
  }}
/>
```

## canCreateEvent

- Type: `function`
- Default: `({ start, end }) => true`

While we are rendering the new event placeholder we will call this method to determine if we can create this event or not.
For example, if you don't want to overlap events, you can return `true | false` based on this `start` & `end` value.

This information will also be available inside the [renderPlaceholder](#renderplaceholder) function.

> **IMPORTANT:** This function will be called a lot of times. This means that this function should be as fast as possible. Don't make API requests in here to determine if we can create the new event.

```js
<Calendar
  canCreateEvent={({ start, end }) => {
    return Math.random() > 0.5; // Russian roulette style
  }}
/>
```

## renderEvent

- Type: `function`
- Default: `Calendar.DEFAULT_RENDER_EVENT`

The `renderEvent` function receives 2 arguments, the first argument is the event itself.
This is 1 item from your `events` prop, this will contain all of its information.

The other argument is the `interactionInfo` object. This object includes useful information if you want to style your events differently based on this information.

The following values are available:

| Property             | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isInteractable`     | If you can interact with an event, then this will be `true`. This means that the [onEventUpdate](#oneventupdate) function has been implemented.        |
| `isInteracting`      | If you are interacting with the current event, then this will be `true`. Possible interactions are when you move an event or when you resize an event. |
| `isOtherInteracting` | If there is an event that is currently being interacted with, but it is not this event.                                                                |
| `isPseudo`           | When you interact with an event, we will create a pseudo event. If this pseudo event is the current event, this boolean will be `true`.                |
| `isUpdatingAllowed`  | If the event can be updated, see [canUpdateEvent](#canupdateevent) section then this value will be `true`.                                             |

> **NOTE**: If you return `null` from this function, the event won't be rendered at all.

```js
<Calendar renderEvent={(event, interactionInfo) => <div>...</div>} />
```

## renderPlaceholder

- Type: `function`
- Default: `Calendar.DEFAULT_RENDER_PLACEHOLDER`

The `renderEvent` function receives 2 arguments, the first argument is the event itself.
This is 1 item from your `events` prop, this will contain all of its information.

The other argument is the `interactionInfo` object. This object includes useful information if you want to style your events differently based on this information.

The following values are available:

| Property            | Description                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isCreatingAllowed` | If the event can be created, see [canCreateEvent](#cancreateevent) section then this value will be `true`. |

```js
<Calendar renderPlaceholder={(event, interactionInfo) => <div>...</div>} />
```
